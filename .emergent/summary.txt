The AI engineer successfully built and iteratively refined the Dinner Parties of New York website, initially as a React application with a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The core focus was on achieving a sophisticated Art Deco aesthetic, responsive design, and core landing page functionality. Key iterations involved comprehensive design feedback from the user, leading to multiple adjustments in typography, color palette, layout, logo integration, background patterns, and micro-interactions. The conversation culminated in a complete pivot from the React application to a static HTML/CSS/JS site, optimized for GitHub Pages. The AI engineer was in the process of creating this static output, ensuring relative asset paths and a specific directory structure, fulfilling the user's detailed requirements for a production-ready, performant, and accessible static website.

The goal is to create a Dinner Parties of New York website with an Art Deco elegance meets NYC grit aesthetic, mimicking a 1930s Manhattan supper-club.
The application should include:
1.  **Home Page**: Centered title, Art Deco frame around a 16:9 YouTube video embed (from ), a Get Invited script-style CTA button, and a footer with social icons (Instagram, YouTube, X, TikTok).
2.  **Invite Form Page (/invite)**: Centered elegant form panel with fields for Name, Email, and a 280-character Short Bio (with live counter), an opt-in checkbox, and validation. Form submissions were initially mocked, with a future plan to integrate with Google Forms or an Apps Script webhook, including an hCaptcha/Turnstile placeholder.
3.  **Thank You Page (/thank-you)**: A minimal confirmation message with a link back to the home page.

**Aesthetic Direction**: The design evolved from an initial elegant look to a refined Art Deco style directly inspired by an uploaded logo. This includes angular geometry, architectural symmetry, stepped borders, sunburst patterns, and a specific color palette (Brass: #C8A96B, Warm Ivory: #F5F2EA, Espresso Black: #1A1A1A). Typography was refined to match the logo (tall, condensed Deco sans serif for headings, warm serif for body, clean calligraphic for CTA). Backgrounds feature subtle Art Deco line patterns with optional grain textures. Micro-interactions include brushed-brass glint on hover, with slow, cinematic motion. The design also mandates strict responsiveness across all devices and aspect ratios.

**Final Deliverable Shift**: The application must be delivered as a complete, production-ready static HTML/CSS/JS repository, optimized for GitHub Pages with a custom domain (). This requires no frameworks (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only), minimal file sizes (CSS+JS combined ≤100KB gzipped), specific repository root structure (e.g., , ), relative asset paths, high Lighthouse scores (Perf ≥90, A11y ≥95, BP ≥95, SEO ≥95), self-hosted WOFF2 fonts, optimized images (AVIF/WEBP + JPEG), YouTube poster-then-play behavior, comprehensive accessibility, SEO meta/schema, a Content Security Policy, and a detailed .

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React/FastAPI/MongoDB**: Initial full-stack architecture.
-   **Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS**: Frontend component library and styling framework.
-   **Responsive Design**: Ensuring layout adapts to all screen sizes and aspect ratios.
-   **Art Deco Aesthetic**: Detailed design principles applied through CSS.
-   **Static Site Generation**: Transitioning from React to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for GitHub Pages.
-   **Performance/SEO/Accessibility**: Lighthouse metrics, semantic HTML, self-hosted fonts, image optimization.
-   **Form Handling**: Integration with Google Forms or Apps Script webhook, hCaptcha/Turnstile.
-   **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Specific directory structure (), relative paths, .

<code_architecture>
The application started as a full-stack React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. However, the final deliverable shifts to a static HTML/CSS/JS site optimized for GitHub Pages.

**Initial (React) Directory Structure (relevant parts):**


**Target (Static) Directory Structure for GitHub Pages:**


**Key Files Examined/Modified (React Phase):**
-   : Initial React router setup and API calls. Modified to integrate new React pages.
-   : Extensively modified over multiple iterations to define the Art Deco color palette, typography, background patterns (geometric lines), element positioning (logo, video frame, CTA, socials), and responsive breakpoints. This file encapsulates the core visual design.
-   : Used for Tailwind base styles and defining CSS variables for the color palette, which was updated to match the Art Deco brass, ivory, and black.
-   : Modified to remove Emergent branding from metadata and update the title.
-   : The main landing page component. Underwent numerous changes to implement the dynamic logo, gold header lines, the geometric video frame (YouTube embed), tagline, Get Invited button (positioning, legibility), and footer with social icons. Contains the primary layout logic.
-   : The form page component. Restyled to match the Art Deco aesthetic with brass accents for labels and an ivory card panel.
-   : The confirmation page component. Simplified and restyled with minimal text and Art Deco accents.

**Transition to Static Files:**
The AI engineer started generating static HTML, CSS, and JS files (, , , , ) into temporary directories, aiming to mirror the current React application's design and functionality as vanilla code. This involved extracting styling and logic from the React components and  into static equivalents.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of the form plumbing on , connecting it to either a Google Forms endpoint or an Apps Script Webhook.
-   Integration of hCaptcha or Turnstile placeholder within the form.
-   Detailed  generation, including instructions for deployment, YouTube configuration, form wiring options, social link replacement, and performance/accessibility checklists.
-   Finalizing the static site assets: , , , , ,  in the  directory.
-   Image optimization (AVIF/WEBP + JPEG fallbacks) and self-hosted WOFF2 fonts implementation.
-   Adding the Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of converting the existing React application into a production-ready static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript site. This conversion is specifically targeted for deployment on GitHub Pages, following a strict  directory structure. The user has provided an extremely detailed specification for this static output, including requirements for file organization, performance metrics, accessibility, SEO, form handling, and specific asset types.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully created the initial static HTML pages (, , ), a minified CSS file (), and a JavaScript file () within a temporary directory, with the intention to place them in . The user's most recent instruction (Chat Message 227) reiterated the precise  structure, emphasized relative paths, and clarified that the deployed repository should not include build tools or GitHub Actions. The AI engineer confirmed understanding and is proceeding with populating the  directory accordingly. The core task at hand is migrating the fully refined Art Deco design and functionality from the React codebase into this vanilla static structure.
